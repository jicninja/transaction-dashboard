Code Challenge: Payment Transaction Dashboard
Estimated time for completion:  45 minutes

Problem Statement:
You are tasked with building a prototype of a payment transaction dashboard using React.js and TypeScript. Your goal is to create a web application that simulates displaying payment transaction data. The application should allow users to view a list of payment transactions and filter transactions by date range.

Requirements:
- Display a list of past transactions, each with a unique ID a , use a promise that returns an array with the past transactions.
- Display a target amount input field that users can use to check if any two transactions add up to that target.
+ After the user enters a target amount and clicks “Check Transactions,” display the indices (or IDs) of two transactions that add up to that target.
+ If no two transactions add up to the target, display a message like “No matching transactions found.”
- Users should be able to add new transactions (ID and amount) to the list.


Bonus Points (Optional):
- Display any validation or error messages if necessary (e.g., for invalid inputs). (Bonus points)


Constraints:
- Third-party APIs are not allowed. You must use a mock API for data.
- You can use any libraries or packages you find suitable for this task.
- The application should be designed with best practices for performance, maintainability, and scalability in mind.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code organization and structure.
- Correctness and functionality of the application.
- Proper error handling and user feedback.
- Code quality, adherence to TypeScript best practices, and readability.
- Responsive and visually appealing user interface.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
